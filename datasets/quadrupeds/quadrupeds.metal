animals.c and animals.info are UCI originals (.info was .names originally)
a.c and the executable a are modified versions (producing output in "our" format)
quadruped.data and quadruped.names are a 5000 sample for seed 1

as is, I think its pretty useless, as the four classes are trivially separable.
